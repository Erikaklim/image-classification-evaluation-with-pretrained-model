# Image Classification and Evaluation Using a Pretrained Model

- Implemented data loading and preprocessing using a pre-trained EfficientNetV2-S image classification model.
- Calculated accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics for selected images from OpenImages.
- Implemented threshold adjustment functionality, allowing images to be classified for each specified class (out of three) by varying the threshold Tâˆˆ[0,1].
